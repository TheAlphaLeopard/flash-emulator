This is [Swfify](https://github.com/TheAlphaLeopard/swfify)! An Adobe Flash emulator/player built using [ruffle.rs](ruffle.rs)!
I made this because I was bored and found a bunch of flash games, but the ruffle.rs demo was booooriiing...

Instructions:
1. Download the .zip folder
2. Extract the .zip folder
3. Open the .html file
4. Start playing your flash games!

Notes:
1. When you are on the .HTML file, Press the enter key to open up a .swf file!
2. You don't have to have multiple tabs of it open, it saves your progress with each .swf file! (*NOTE: Saves when your computer is on, if your computer is turned off or closed progress will be deleted.)
3. Working on saving data!
4. Have fun!
