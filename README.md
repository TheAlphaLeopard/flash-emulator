This Adobe Flash emulator is built off [ruffl.rs](https://ruffle.rs) and made entirely with HTML, JS, and CSS!

THE JOURNEY:

It was simple at first, you had a button and you clicked on it to open a .swf file.
Then I realesed it would be easier to press the enter key! Not only did this simplify the player but it made it run at least 1 FPS faster!
Then my friends kept begging for saving so, it took me a while but I added saving via localStorage!
If you have any problems, suggestions, feedback, etc. Then hit me up and I'll respond!
Im going to keep making this project better and better!
